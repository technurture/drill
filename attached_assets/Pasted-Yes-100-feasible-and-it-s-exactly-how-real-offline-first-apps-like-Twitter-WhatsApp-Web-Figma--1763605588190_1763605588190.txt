Yes — 100% feasible, and it’s exactly how real offline-first apps like Twitter, WhatsApp Web, Figma, Notion, and Gmail work.
This pattern is called:
🚀 Offline-First App with Optimistic UI + Background Sync
Your architecture will have 3 layers:
✅ 1. Optimistic UI (Frontend)
When the user performs an action offline:
You immediately update the UI
Save the action to IndexedDB (local database)
Return a temporary local ID
Do NOT call your API yet
This makes the app feel fully online even when offline.
Example:
// optimistic UI update
addMessageToUI(tempId, message);

// save action to local store
await indexedDB.savePendingAction({
  type: "create_message",
  payload: { tempId, message },
});
✅ 2. Service Worker – Background Sync
When internet returns:
Service worker detects “online”
Reads pending actions from IndexedDB
Sends them to your backend one-by-one
Replaces temporary IDs with real IDs
Clears the pending queue
Example SW logic:
self.addEventListener("sync", async (event) => {
  if (event.tag === "sync-actions") {
    event.waitUntil(processPendingActions());
  }
});
This is exactly what you want:
➡ offline actions execute instantly on UI
➡ sync happens silently later
✅ 3. Local-First Data Storage
To make the interface fully offline, you must store:
user data
cached API responses
lists
messages
profile
settings
notifications
…all in IndexedDB, not localStorage.
You can use:
Dexie.js (best & easiest)
LocalForage
PouchDB
RxDB
Example:
const db = new Dexie("app");
db.version(1).stores({
  todos: "id, text, completed",
  pendingActions: "++id, type, payload",
});
🔥 What Happens When Offline?
Example scenario:
User creates a new Post while offline
They click Create Post
You update the UI immediately (optimistic)
Save the action to IndexedDB
Service worker tries sync → fails → queued
User still sees the post in UI (temporary state)
When the user comes back online:
sync-actions fires
Service worker sends queued actions to server
On success, SW updates IndexedDB
Frontend reloads data or receives sync event
Temporary UI states are replaced with real data
